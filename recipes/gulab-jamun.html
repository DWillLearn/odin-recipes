    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Gulab jamun are delicious berry-sized balls made with milk solids, flour,
      and a leavening agent before being soaked in a rose flavored sugar. The
      word "Gulab" translates to rose in Hindi and "jamun" to berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gulab jamun is a very famous Indian desert and is enjoyed during most
      festive and celebratory meals. Traditionally, gulab jamun is made using
      khoya (milk solids) as the main ingredient. However, khoya is not readily
      available in most places and using milk powder as a substitute is fine.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For Jamun</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
      <li>5 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 tbsp plain yogurt</li>
      <li>2 cups ghee or oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For Sugar Syrup</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
      <li>4 pods green cardamom or 1/4 tsp cardamom powder</li>
      <li>1 tsp rose water</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp saffron</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan;
        bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5
        to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined.
        Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab
        dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C). Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of
        dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming
        to the surface, the oil is ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown
        on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate.
        Repeat with remaining gulab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat
        and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
      </li>
    </ol>
