  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Naan is a type of traditional Indian flat bread. Traditionally, they are baked inside a very hot clay tandoor oven,
    with charcoal or wood fire.</p>
  <p>In a modern day kitchen, we do not have a tandoor oven. However, you can make naan at home with a hot cast-iron
    skillet on the stove stop, or bake in the oven.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-rising flour</li>
    <li>Plain yogurt</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix the flour and yogurt until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a flour-dusted work surface, then knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Add more flour as needed if the dough
      becomes too sticky</li>
    <li> Pat the dough into a rectangle. Divide into eight equal portions, lightly flatten, and shape into a
      semi-rectangular shape.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet over medium heat. Add one or two pieces of dough and cook until they begin to
      bubble and brown. Flip and continue cooking until both sides are cooked.
